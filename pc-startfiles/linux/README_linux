Linux installation:

Simple:
Move both the "SwtPra10-pc-1.3.2-all.jar" and the files in this directory (*.desktop and *.sh files) into a directory
of your choice. You can either use the "Ausrichter.sh"/"Ausrichter-wayland.sh" and
"Beobachter.sh"/"Beobachter-wayland.sh" files to start the program through a simple shell script. For this to work, you
also have to set the executable bit on the aforementioned files.

System integrated method:
If you want the application to show up in a launcher of your choice, you have to either manually move the *.desktop
files, either in your home directory ($HOME/.local/share/applications/) for user specific installation, or to the
system wide location (/usr/local/share/applications/). After that you have to move the "SwtPra10-pc-1.3.2-all.jar" to
the /opt/ directory.

For user specific installation, you can also use the included linux-install.sh. Make sure the files (.jar and *.desktop)
are present in the same directory, as the linux-install.sh and set the executable bit of this file. As the .jar is
copied to /opt/, sudo is needed on your systems for this method to work.

Wayland:
The *-wayland* files add a java launch option to better support wayland compositors. If the application does not launch
in your desktop environment/compositor/window manager, you can try to launch the application through the wayland file.
In X11 environments, this should not be necessary.
