Mac installation:

Move both the "SwtPra10-pc-1.3.2-all.jar" and "Ausrichter.command", "Beobachter.command" and "Engine.sh" into a
directory of your choice. After that, double clicking either .command file should start the corresponding component.

To start the engine player with default argument, simply execute the "Engine.sh" in a directory with
the "SwtPra10-pc-1.3.2-all.jar" present. Also make sure to set the executable bit on the "Engine.sh" file before.
