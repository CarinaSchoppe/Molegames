Windows installation:

Move both the "SwtPra10-pc-1.3.2-all.jar" and "Ausrichter.bat", "Beobachter.bat" as well as Engine.bat into a directory
of your choice. After that, double clicking either .bat file should start the corresponding component.

The "Engine.bat" should start an AI player with the default IP 127.0.0.1 and port 33100.
